# [Emoji Search](http://jayeh.me/emoji-search)

This is my implementation of an example React for searching for emojis.  Check
it out at [jayeh.me](http://jayeh.me/emoji-search).  I have drawn on:

- Ideas and data from
  [ahfarmer/emoji-search](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search)
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for
  generating the initial project structure
- Best practices for component files structures as suggested by [Charlres
  Stover](https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/optimal-file-structure-for-react-applications-f3e35ad0a145)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling

## Features

You can filter emojis with a search bar. Matching text in the emoji title or
keywords is highlighted. Emojis can be selected by hovering with the mouse.
Clicking (or hitting `Enter` in the search box) will copy the selected to emoji
to the clipboard.

## Install

```
yarn install
```

## Run

```
yarn start
```
